Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Divide and Conquer Algorithm
Divide and conquer algorithms are a problem-solving technique that involves breaking down a large, complex problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems, solving these subproblems recursively, and then combining the solutions to solve the original problem. This approach is often used in computer science to design efficient algorithms.
